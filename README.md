# Git HipChat Hook

A simple GIT `post-receive` hook script for notifying a room in HipChat.

## Installation

Clone this repository somewhere in your GIT repository host server.

```sh
git clone git://github.com/eirc/git-hipchat-hook.git
```

Clone [hipchat-cli](https://github.com/hipchat/hipchat-cli) somewhere in your GIT repository host server.

```sh
git clone git://github.com/hipchat/hipchat-cli.git
```

Go to the `hooks` directory in a bare repository you want to setup the hooks for and add a `post-receive` script like this one and make sure its executable:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

HIPCHAT_SCRIPT="/path/to/hipchat/room/message"
HIPCHAT_ROOM="HipChat room name"
HIPCHAT_TOKEN="1234567890"
HIPCHAT_FROM="GIT"

. /path/to/hipchat-post-receive
```

And you're done!

For GitWeb and Redmine integrations (optional) add the following configuration to the `post-receive` hook before the `hipchat-post-receive` source line.

```sh
CGIT="git.example.com/cgit"
GITWEB="gitweb.example.com"
REDMINE="redmine.example.com"
```
