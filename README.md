# Git HipChat Hook

A simple GIT `post-receive` hook script for notifying a room in HipChat.

## Installation

Clone this repository somewhere in your GIT repository host server.
For example:

```sh
cd /home/git
git clone git://github.com/eirc/git-hipchat-hook.git
```

Clone [hipchat-cli](https://github.com/hipchat/hipchat-cli) somewhere in your GIT repository host server.

```sh
git clone git://github.com/hipchat/hipchat-cli.git
```

Go to the `hooks` directory in a bare repository you want to setup the hooks for and add a `post-receive` script like this one and make sure it's executable.

You can lookup the HipChat room id from the [rooms/list](https://www.hipchat.com/docs/api/method/rooms/list) API or use the HipChat room name (remember to urlencode it)

```sh
#!/bin/sh

HIPCHAT_SCRIPT="/path/to/hipchat_room_message"
HIPCHAT_ROOM="HipChat room name or room_id"
HIPCHAT_TOKEN="1234567890"
HIPCHAT_FROM="GIT"

. /path/to/hipchat-post-receive
```
If using gitorious make sure to add GIT_PROJECT="Name of project" to the hook:
```sh
#!/bin/sh

HIPCHAT_SCRIPT="/path/to/hipchat_room_message"
HIPCHAT_ROOM="HipChat room name or room_id"
HIPCHAT_TOKEN="1234567890"
HIPCHAT_FROM="GIT"
GIT_PROJECT="MyScripts"

. /path/to/hipchat-post-receive
```
For Redmine make sure to include REDMINE_PROJECT and REDMINE_PROJECT_NAME.
```
REDMINE_PROJECT="my-project"
REDMINE_PROJECT_NAME="My Project"
```
Also remember that you'll need to [notify Redmine to refresh the repository](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/HowTo_setup_automatic_refresh_of_repositories_in_Redmine_on_commit#Git), otherwise the link to a commit won't work.

And you're done!

For GitWeb, CGit, Gitorious and Redmine integrations (optional) add the following configuration to the `post-receive` hook before the `hipchat-post-receive` source line.

Note that CGit and GitWeb, and Redmine and JIRA, are mutually exclusive.

```sh
CGIT="http://git.example.com/cgit"
GITWEB="http://gitweb.example.com"
JIRA="http://jira.example.com"
REDMINE="http://redmine.example.com"
GITORIOUS="http://gitorious.example.com"
```
